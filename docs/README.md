The Spirit of PRPM Radio
PRPM was inspired by the original hackers of the airwaves ‚Äì those who built their own antennas, powered their transmitters, and broadcast on unauthorized frequencies. We might not literally bust into the airwaves, but we do let you take back control of your media library. No corporate overlords gating your content; no app store controlling your feed.

Take back podcasting, tune in, and share the signal. Reclaim the spirit of independent broadcasting.

Stay loud. Stay free.
